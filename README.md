PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The objective to creating Global Explorer is to provide users with local information about a specific City.  The information includes local time, weather conditions, a Google map, photo, a list of events and a list of places to eat. The event listings also include link to purchase tickets. The restaurant listings include diner ratings. 

## The Project has the following acceptance criteria


```
AS a user, when I input a City, I want the search bar to automatically generate a list of cities for me to select. 

When I input a City, I want to be presented with a quick overview of the city's local information including local time, current weather conditions and a photo of the City. 

When I input a City, I want to be presented with a list of upcoming events and an ability to purchase tickets for these events. 

When I input a City, I want to be presented with a list of recommendations for places to eat with diner ratings. 


## Process Overview:

Our team combined individual html codes into one index file to create the main page for Global Explorer.  The main index file is linked to separate JS files that are utilizing the various APIs and libraries used for this application. 

For styling, we mostly utilized MDBootstrap to contain the various components of our page.  

There were challenges with combining APIs and utilizing Google's places for autocomplete as various APIs respond to different search criteria. 

Overall, the project provided a great learning experience for everyone in our team working with various APIs and libraries.
